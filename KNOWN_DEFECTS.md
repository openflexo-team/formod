# formod — Known defects

Bugs of formod (the B technology adapter, the Formose module and its resource center) that are known and not fixed yet. Each entry
says what is verified, how to reproduce it, and how to work around it. Features and evolutions go to `BACKLOG.md`, not here.

Identifiers are stable and never reused: `FORMOD-D-<n>`. Reference them from commits and from other entries.

## B parser

### FORMOD-D-1 — The B grammar has no real literals  ·  `TODO`

**Symptom.** Parsing a B expression holding a real number fails: `BParser.parse("1.5", factory, EntryPointKind.Expression)` throws
`ParseException: [1,2] expecting: EOF`.

**Reproduction (verified 2026-09-16 by execution).** `TestParseBExpression.testExpression7` in `b-ta-test` fails with that exception.

**Mechanism — verified in the grammar.** `b-ta-parser/src/main/sablecc/b.sablecc` only declares `integer_literal = digit+`; there is
no real literal token nor any `expression` alternative for one. The lexer reads `1`, then `.` cannot continue the expression.

**Not a 2.99 migration regression.** The grammar is unchanged since the initial import (2020-03), so the test could not pass before
the migration either.

**Workaround.** None in B text: real values cannot be written in expressions handled by the B technology adapter.
